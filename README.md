# lcd-screen-library
QAPASS 1602A LCD Screen Module driver library, for Atmega328P ( Arduino UNO R3's micro processor )
I followed Patrick Hood Daniel's great videos on the LCD Module, and changed it to fit my own needs.

## Wire Configuration

The library supports only 8bit data configuration. as such, it must be wired accordingly.
Please connect the following terminals for succesful use:
LCD Module | Arduino Terminal
-----------------------------
VSS        | LOW
VDD        | HIGH
V0         | VARIABLE_VOLTAGE  <-- Connect through a 10kOhm Potentiometer
RS         | 10
RW         | 11
E          | 12
D0-D7      | 2-9
A          | HIGH
K          | LOW

For further information refer to the datasheet or the Patrick Hood Daniel's youtube videos on the LCD Module


## How to compile and run
You can follow this guide in order to set up AVRdude programmer with your Atmel Studio 7 IDE:
https://www.asensar.com/guide/arduino_atemlstudio/integrate-avrdude-with-atmel-studio.html

After setting up, click tools-> AVRDUDE programmer ( or whichever name you chose ) to program your MCU.

## Notes
I also added an example driver program, you can find how to set up your module and get it ready to display characters
Cheers!
